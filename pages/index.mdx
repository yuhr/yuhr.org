I mainly am a freelance software engineer. Speaking Japanese natively and English like a <Tooltip content="Then I have to say—meow.">👶</Tooltip> but can read/write formal English such as whitepapers.

Current interest: see my tweets on [@qothr](https://twitter.com/qothr). Usually I'm working on creating my own programming language (closed yet), writing about analytic aesthetics around [百合](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_(genre)>) on [note](https://note.com/yuhr), creating packages for [SATySFi](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi), studying illustrations, and so on.
