I mainly am a freelance software engineer. Speaking Japanese natively and English like a <Tooltip content="Then I have to sayâ€”meow.">ðŸ‘¶</Tooltip> but can read/write formal English such as whitepapers.

Current interest: see my tweets on [@exograph](https://twitter.com/exograph). Usually I'm working on creating my own programming language (closed yet), creating a [toolchain](https://github.com/yuhr/langue) for conlanging, [DJing](https://www.mixcloud.com/exograph/), studying illustrations, and so on.
