# Hiring

Feel free to contact me via email ([mail@yuhr.org](mailto:mail@yuhr.org)) or Twitter ([@exograph](https://twitter.com/exograph)).

- You can see what I can in general at [this page](/skillsets). Tracking my activities on GitHub ([@yuhr](https://github.com/yuhr)) is also a good idea.
- I live in Niigata, Japan. Online meeting (using Zoom or some) is always preferable to physical meeting which is still possible if needed.
